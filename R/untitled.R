lnRR<-log(EMean / CMean)  # So when EMean is higher than ratio is above 0, effect size is positive and females have larger mean; when EMean is lower than ratio is below zero and effect size is negative and males have larger mean. Same is true of VR ratio.

ES<-(log(ESD) - log(EMean) + 1 / (2*(EN - 1))) - (log(CSD) - log(CMean) + 1 / (2*(CN - 1))); #When EMean is higher = females have increased variance and when EMean is smaller females have higher variance
